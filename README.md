# capstone_project_T14_cipher
As part of the HyperionDev bootcamp, task 14, I was challenged to create a JavaScript programme that would take in a statment and create a code message.

The requirments:
- Using an array containing the alphabet was not allowed.
- The code must shuffle letters 15 steps up in the alphabet
- The alphabet would work cyclicly
- - example: to change W by 15 letters, the programme counted: X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, etc. ending up as an L.
- Non letter characters were not to be changes
- Capitals and Lowercase stayed as capitals and lower case.
